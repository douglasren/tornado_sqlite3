database.py is a thin wrapper over sqlite3 that allows python scripts to
retrieve and treat table records as dictionary objects.

It is derived from Tornado's MySQL adapter 
https://github.com/facebook/tornado/blob/master/tornado/database.py
It allows you to build Tornado apps that work with SQLite3
using the same API that Tornado provides in its database module.

This can be useful because Sqlite comes pre-installed with python
so it allows you to build a Test Tornado app without 
having to install MySQL.

database does not need depend on Tornado. It only needs 'sqlite3'
which is packaged in Python 2.6. So it can be used in python apps
independent of Tornado.

To use database.py with Tornado, you can either replace tornado/database.py
with this database.py, or place database.py in your Python path,
and import database instead of import tornado.database


A sample program using database_sqlite3 is in demo.py
To run it  
% python demo.py

A sample Tornado app using database_sqlite3 is in demo_tornado.py
To run it
